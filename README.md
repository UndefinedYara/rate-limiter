⏱️ Rate Limiter Playground

Welcome to my little corner of chaos where I’m learning (and occasionally fighting) different rate limiting algorithms!

This repo is basically me experimenting with:

- Fixed Window

- Leaky + Token Buckets

- Sliding Window

- Redis magic

I’m just studying, trying things, breaking things, and hopefully understanding how real systems don’t catch fire under load.

If you see weird logs, questionable math, or existential comments…
yes, that’s part of the journey. 😄

Feel free to explore!
